# Kustomize GitHub Actions

The custom action that we have created includes certain variables (which we refer to as inputs). These inputs are deemed necessary in order for the action to perform the specific work it is intended to do. As such, only minimal parameters are used, wherein such parameters are essential to the task at hand. It's important to note that the CI part may vary based on the repository needs.
